## 🛠️ What is Izatel?

**Izatel** is an internal dev tool created to streamline work on my long-term modpack project, **Project Izatel** — an MMORPG-style Minecraft pack I’ve been building since 2023.

This app exists because managing tons of mods (some essential) is chaos without good tools. Izatel will eventually be a **suite of tools** built to make modpack development easier, more visual, and way less annoying.

## 📦 First Module: PMMOEdit

The first tool in the Izatel suite is **PMMOEdit**, which focuses on editing config files for the [Project MMO](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/project-mmo) mod.

###  Current Features

-  **Skill Page** – Visual interface for managing skills.
-  **New File Initialization** – Pressing "New File" auto-fills default skills into the editor.
-  **Full Skill Control** – Add, edit, or delete skills with ease.
-  **TOML Export** – Instantly generate clean, accurate TOML config files ready to drop into your modpack.

## 🚧 What's Next?

I plan to expand Izatel with more modules for handling different mods, data packs, and overall pack structure. If you're into modding or MMORPG-style packs, stay tuned.
